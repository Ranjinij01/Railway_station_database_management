The Railway System Database manages train information, schedules, reservations, station details, and passenger bookings. It simplifies handling arrival/departure timings and seat availability.

The very first thing your management system should have is the Train and Schedule management, so create a database to store details of all trains like train name, its id, routes, departure and arrival time, and stops.
Now, passengers can book tickets online or at stations desk and using the management system they can reserve the ticket and for that you have to automate the updation system.
After every update, seat availability will be change and it should be provided in real time.
The system should update about the train status, like delays, and send notifications to passengers about any change in train scheduling.

The main aspect of this management system is security, so you have to implement security in your management system.
